I design and build intelligent iOS applications powered by machine learning, real-time audio/vision processing, and clean user experiences. I’ve published multiple apps on the App Store, engineered ML and backend systems, and collaborated with diverse teams through the Apple Developer Academy.

My strengths include:

* On-device ML (CoreML, custom models, real-time inference)
* SwiftUI architecture (MVVM, SwiftData, AVFoundation)
* Backend development (Flask, REST APIs, WebSockets)
* Full-stack ML systems (data → model → API → mobile interface)
